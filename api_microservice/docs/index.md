# Welcome to the FSD Public API Documentation

## Project Overview

### Business Context

Blockchain technology has revolutionized the financial industry since its inception, with Bitcoin being the most prominent example. As the first and most recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin paved the way for numerous alternative coins (altcoins), each offering unique features and use cases. However, the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, with prices often fluctuating dramatically. This volatility presents both opportunities and challenges for various stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and developers. Understanding the underlying patterns of this market is crucial for making informed decisions that can lead to maximizing profits and minimizing risks.

### Problems and Opportunities

The cryptocurrency market's volatility is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it creates opportunities for significant profits; on the other, it poses substantial risks for investors. The primary problem is the lack of understanding and predictability of these market fluctuations, which can lead to uninformed decisions and potential losses. However, this volatility also presents an opportunity for stakeholders to develop strategies that can capitalize on market movements. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, there is an opportunity to gain insights into how different factors, such as Bitcoin’s price movements, market capitalization, and external events like Bitcoin halving, impact the market.

### Vision

Our vision is to create a comprehensive tool that leverages data analysis and visualization to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into the cryptocurrency market. By developing a Python-based analytical engine and an interactive JavaScript dashboard, we aim to offer a platform where users can explore correlations, assess volatility, and understand the impact of significant events on the market. This tool will empower investors to make data-driven decisions, help regulators monitor market stability, and provide enthusiasts and entrepreneurs with a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

### Why is the Project Important?

The importance of this project lies in its potential to demystify the cryptocurrency market for a wide range of stakeholders. As the market continues to grow and attract more participants, the need for reliable tools to analyze and predict market behavior becomes increasingly critical. This project not only addresses the immediate needs of investors and regulators but also contributes to the broader adoption and stability of cryptocurrencies by providing a clearer understanding of their behavior. In a market characterized by rapid changes and uncertainty, the ability to predict and respond to trends can make the difference between success and failure.

## Why the Public API Was Developed Separately

While our primary project focuses on delivering a robust analytical engine and an interactive dashboard for in-depth market analysis, the public API was developed separately to address specific needs and opportunities for broader access and usability. Here’s why this was a crucial decision:

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: The public API provides a streamlined way for developers and stakeholders to integrate our data analysis capabilities into their own applications and tools. By offering programmatic access to our data, we can extend our reach and facilitate greater interaction with our insights.

- **Improved Financial Literacy**: By making our data and visualizations accessible through an API, we aim to promote financial literacy. Users can build custom applications or dashboards that suit their specific needs, helping them understand market trends and make informed decisions.

- **Encouraging Innovation**: The API allows for the creation of new tools and applications that leverage our data, fostering innovation in the financial technology space. This separation enables external developers to experiment and build on our work, leading to novel use cases and solutions.

- **Focused Development**: Developing the API separately ensures that we can tailor it specifically for integration and accessibility without compromising the core functionality and performance of our main analytical tools. This separation of concerns helps maintain a high level of quality and reliability in both the API and the primary application.
