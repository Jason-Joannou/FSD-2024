# FSD Public Financial and Visualization API

While our primary project focuses on delivering a robust analytical engine and an interactive dashboard for in-depth market analysis, the public API was developed separately to address specific needs and opportunities for broader access and usability. 

Hereâ€™s why this was a crucial decision:

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: The public API provides a streamlined way for developers and stakeholders to integrate their own data analysis into their applications and tools. By offering programmatic access to these functions, we can extend our reach and facilitate greater interaction with our users.

- **Improved Financial Literacy**: By making financial analytics and visualizations accessible through an API, we aim to promote financial literacy. Users can build custom applications or dashboards that suit their specific needs, helping them understand market trends and make informed decisions.

- **Encouraging Innovation**: The API allows for the creation of new tools and applications, fostering innovation in the financial technology space. This separation enables external developers to experiment and build on our work, leading to novel use cases and solutions.

- **Focused Development**: Developing the API separately ensures that we can tailor it specifically for integration and accessibility without compromising the core functionality and performance of our main analytical tools. This separation of concerns helps maintain a high level of quality and reliability in both the API and the primary application.
